# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for predicting whether a customer will leave a bank or stay, based on various features using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Introduction


# Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for this analysis is 'Churn_Modelling.csv'. The preprocessing steps include:
- Label encoding "Gender"
- One Hot Encoding "Geography"
- Splitting the datset into training set and testing set
- Feature scaling

# Building and training the ANN
